## Submitting bugs

If you'd like to do it, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/WeatherFlux/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Pierre-Lannoy/WeatherFlux/pulls) to see whether someone else has found the same bug.

If you know how to fix the bug or implement your new feature, please open an issue first to discuss it before submitting a pull request - unless it is a small fix (in which case you can do so directly).
